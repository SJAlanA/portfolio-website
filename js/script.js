        { title: 'Road Accident Detection', technology: 'Python, CNN, OpenCV',description: 'Developed a deep learning model achieving 89.73% AUC, reducing false positives by 10% in real-time accident detection. Implemented Resnet 18 which is a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and trained a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for precise accident classification. Enhanced road safety with an AI-driven mobile app for alerts.' },
        { title: 'Yoga Pose Detection and Correction', technology: 'Python, Machine Learning, OpenCV',description: 'Yoga is a new way to look at the disciplines of our lives, such as physical, mental, and spiritual practices. It is injurious to our health to do yoga poses without an instructor. So here we are going to represent a proposed model for yoga pose detection using a machine-learning algorithm to identify and detect the yoga pose form. Our website works for 8 yoga poses. The input is preprocessed in the form of an image, the object is detected, and the core of the human body is identified using the media pipe and Open CV library. For training and testing data, we use CSV files downloaded from Kaggle. We use Traditional Machine Learning models such as XG Boost and Transfer Learning models such as VGG16 for training and testing. The results of both the models have been compared and the system with the best accuracy score has been employed.' },

As the Projects Student Director, I managed and guided 14 projects across various domains. It was an incredible journey filled with sleepless nights. None of this would have been possible without the hard work of over 100 students. Our main goal was to spread Project-Based Learning (PBL) and multidisciplinary skills at the College of Engineering, Guindy. I\'m proud of what we\'ve achieved together! I\'m thrilled to share that our team recently presented our project at \"Technovation,\" an inter-college competition with over 40 teams from various universities. The range of ideas and solutions on display was truly inspiring! Seeing our project rise above the rest was an incredible moment for us. A huge congratulations to all the winners â€“ your work was outstanding! The event day was a whirlwind of activity, from managing the workflow to ensuring everything ran smoothly. It was a hectic but amazing experience, and I\'m so proud of what we accomplished together. Being the student director of CEG Tech Forum, we conducted an international techno-management fest called KURUKSHETRA which was conducted from 28 Feb to 2 March 2024. Through out my tenure as the student director of CEG Tech Forum, I learnt a lot of stuff not just in my domain projects but also event management, finance and logistics domains. CEG Tech Forum is an excellent platform which not only let\'s you learn from the domain you chose but everything as a whole. I admire the commitment and leadership qualities of all the student directors who worked towards the success of Kurukshetra\'24." },
        { role: 'Marketing Core', organization: 'ECE Association of CEG', duration: 'July 2023 - May 2024', description: "In my role as Marketing Core for the Electronics and Communication Engineering Association, I spearheaded the marketing efforts for two major cultural events, Resonance and Vision. I developed and executed digital marketing strategies, leveraging social media platforms to maximize event visibility and engagement, and conducted promotional visits to various colleges to effectively communicate the value and excitement of our events to potential participants. Managing a team of over 15 junior members, I provided guidance and ensured cohesive and efficient execution of marketing tasks. I coordinated with associations from other colleges to expand our reach and foster a collaborative promotional environment, utilizing Excel to meticulously plan and track marketing strategies, ensuring all initiatives were organized and impactful. As a result, I successfully increased participation from targeted colleges, contributing to the overall success of the events, and enhanced my skills in digital marketing, social media marketing, and in-person marketing, gaining valuable experience in both strategic planning and team management." }
